    "So for instance:\n",
    "$$q_3 = \\frac{s_3 e^{r \\delta t} - s_6}{s_7 - s_6}$$\n",
    "Now we have a value for the claim at time 1; it's worth $f(3)$ if the first jump was up, and $f(2)$ if the first jump was down. But the initial for at time 0, from node 1 to nodes 2 and 3 also has a single-branch structure. Its value at time zero must be:\n",

    "> The probability that the process follows a particular path through the tree is the product of the probabilities of each branch taken. For example, in fig 2.4, the chance of going up twice is the product $q_1 q_3$, the chance of going up and then down is $q_1 (1 - q_3)$, et cetera.\n",

    ">#### Expectation on a tree\n",
    ">The expectation of some claim on the final nodes of a tree is the sum over those nodes of the claim value weighted by the proababilities of paths reaching it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a two-step tree has four possible paths to the end. But each path carries two probabilities attached to it, one for the first time-step and one for the second, thus the path-probability (the probability of following any particular path) must be the probability of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation of a claim is the total of the tree's outcomes, each weighted by its path-probability. When we examine the expression derived above, it is precisely the expectation of the claims discounted by the appropriate interest-rate factor, under the probabilities corresponding to the \"probability-tree\"."

The results from section 2.1 provide a risk-free construction portfolio $(\\phi, \\psi)$ of stock and bond at the root of the branch that can generate the time $n$ claim amount (over a single branch, our improved stock and cash bond are indistinguishable from the stock and bond of the simpler model).\n",

The investor filled in the nodes at the end of the tree with contractual claims, and our mathematics have filled in the rest by constructing portfolios for every branching which guarantee the correct outcome at the next step.\n",

Just as there is for a single branch, there is a constructed portfolio which *despite changing at each tick-time* will inexorably lead to the claim payoff required, *whatever* path the stock actually takes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These construction portfolios can be complex. Instead of a single amount $\\phi$ of stock, we now have a whole number of $\\phi$, one per node. As the stock on the tree changes, so will its amount in our portfolio.
